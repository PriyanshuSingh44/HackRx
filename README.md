This project is an intelligent query‚Äìretrieval system powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **LLMs**. It allows users to ask natural language questions and receive highly accurate answers based solely on the content of a given PDF document. Ideal for automating document comprehension, the system transforms any policy, guideline, or manual into a smart, searchable knowledge base.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

The system implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to ensure accurate and contextually-aware responses:

1. **Document Loading**: Loads a source PDF document (`policy.pdf`) from the local directory at startup.
2. **Indexing**: Splits the document into smaller chunks, converts them into embeddings using Google's Generative AI, and stores them in an in-memory FAISS vector store.
3. **Retrieval**: Searches the FAISS index for the most relevant chunks when a question is asked.
4. **Generation**: Feeds the question and relevant chunks to the Gemini model to generate a precise answer strictly based on the document.

## ‚úÖ Success Response Example (200 OK)

```
{
  "answers": [
    "The provided text states that if the insured person has opted for installment payments (half-yearly, quarterly, or monthly), there is a 15-day grace period to pay the installment premium.  During this grace period, coverage is not available.  If the payment isn't received within the grace period, the policy is cancelled.",
    "The waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) is 36 months of continuous coverage after the date of inception of the first policy with the insurer.  This waiting period can be reduced if the insured has continuous coverage without a break, as defined by IRDAI portability regulations.",
    "No, this policy does not cover expenses related to pregnancy, childbirth, or their consequences.",
    "The provided text does not specify a waiting period for cataract surgery.  While cataract surgery is listed as a covered procedure (item 6), there's no mention of a waiting period associated with it.",
    "Yes, but only under specific conditions.  The policy covers medical expenses incurred by an organ donor during hospitalization for organ harvesting for the insured person, provided the donation conforms to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the expenses are reasonable and customary charges, and the claim is subject to the annual sum insured limit.  Importantly, pre- and post-hospitalization expenses, screening expenses, other medical expenses resulting from harvesting, and costs associated with organ acquisition (other than hospitalization costs) are excluded.",
    "I'm sorry, but this document does not contain information about a No Claim Discount (NCD).",
    "Yes, there is a benefit for preventive health check-ups.  The specifics depend on the policy variant and whether it's an individual or family floater policy.  The benefit is available once per year per insured person on a cashless basis, using a pre-defined package at network providers.  For long-term policies (2 or 3 years), all policy years' check-ups are provided at the start of the first year.  There are also additional benefits available after a certain number of claim-free years.",
    "The policy defines a Hospital as any institution established for inpatient care and day care treatment of illness and/or injuries, registered as a hospital with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010, or under enactments specified in Section 56(1) of that Act, or meeting specific minimum criteria.  These criteria include having qualified nursing staff and medical practitioners on-site 24/7, a minimum number of inpatient beds (10 or 15 depending on location), a fully equipped operating theatre, and maintaining accessible daily patient records.",
    "The provided text states that coverage for AYUSH treatments will cover Medical Expenses incurred during the Policy Period up to the Annual Sum Insured specified in the Policy Schedule.  This is provided that the expenses are reasonable and customary charges, the treatment occurs at an AYUSH hospital or day-care center, hospitalization commences and continues on the advice of a medical practitioner, and the total expenses don't exceed the annual sum insured.",
    "The provided text states that if a room/ICU accommodation is chosen where the room rent or category is higher than the eligible limit for the insured person, the associated medical expenses will be pro-rated according to the applicable limits.  However, the specific limits for Plan A are not included in this text."
